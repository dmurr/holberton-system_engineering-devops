### OSI model
Open System Interconnection model is a reference model for how applications communicate over a network. Organized into a 7 layer architecture from Low-level to high-level.

### What is a LAN?
Local Area Networks are groups of devices that share a link to a server. Generally used to cover an office or commercial building. Devices may use a LAN to share resources like connecting to a printer. Ethernet and Wifi are typical ways to enable LAN connections.

### What is a WAN?
A wide area network is a geographically distributed network of interconnected LANs. Examples being cellular data networks like 4G LTE, public wifi, or satellite connection.

### What is the Internet?
The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use TCP/IP.

### IP address
A unique address designated for a machine connected to the internet.

### What are the 2 types of IP address?
IPv4: 32 bit grouping of 4 numbers separated by .
IPv6: Allows for significantly more connected devices. However, the two are not interoperable making the switch challenging.

### What is localhost?
In computer networking localhost refers to this computer.

### Why IPv6 was created?
IPv6 was created due to the need for more unique addresses.

### TCP/UDP
TCP/UDP both transfer packets of information through networks.

### What is the main difference between TCP and UDP?
UDP is faster and built for streaming information, no error checking (the sender does not wait to see if the packet was recieved). 
TCP/UDP Ports

### What is a port?
A port is the software-level (Operating System) endpoint of communication. Ports are always associated with an IP address.

### Standardized Ports
22 SSH
80 HTTP
443 HTTPS

### What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network?
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
